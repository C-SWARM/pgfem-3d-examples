What is problem about?
=====================
Soving a one way coupled thermo-mechanical prblem. With fixed bounday, the body expands due to thermal expansions. The purpose of this problem is to verify the momentum and energy equation coupling. The resiual stress due to the thermal expansion can be caculated analytically and the numerical solution can be compared with the analytical solution.

How to run this problem?
=======================
a) Generate the input via processing pipeline

  need recent version of gcc, e.g., gcc/7.1.0
  $./local_makeset.pl clean [to clean any existing input]
  $./local_makeset.pl -np 4 [to create input for a 4-core job; you can create input for any number of cores] 

  It will create a direcoty \box_4CPU containing all inputs

b) Run the pgfem_3d with the generated inputs 
  $./run.sh [please make sure to adjust the pgfem_3d's executable ("PGFem3D") location]

c) Visualize the displacement via paraview

  1. After loading the paraview module "module load paraview/5.3.0", open its GUI "paraview &" 
  2. File -> Load State -> select the file "parview_displacement_y.pvsm" or "parview_displacement_z.pvsm" and click OK
  3. Click onto the "Play" button to see the affect of thermal expension
